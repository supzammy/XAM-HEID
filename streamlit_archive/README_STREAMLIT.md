# Archived Streamlit ML Backend for XAM HEID

This folder contains an archived Streamlit prototype. The active project no longer uses Streamlit for the frontend. The backend modules (data loading, pattern mining, QA) remain in `streamlit_backend/` and can be repurposed for a FastAPI service or other integration.

Files archived here: the original `streamlit_app.py`, `requirements.txt`, and README for the prototype.
